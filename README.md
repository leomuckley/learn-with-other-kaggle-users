Python code for a Kaggle beginner-friendly competition (top 1% finish)

In the competition I predicted what types of trees there are in an area based on various geographic features.
The competition datasets comes from a study conducted in four wilderness areas within the beautiful Roosevelt National Forest 
of northern Colorado. These areas represent forests with very little human disturbances â€“ the existing forest cover types 
there are more a result of ecological processes rather than forest management practices.

The data is in raw form and contains categorical data such as wilderness areas and soil type.

Submissions were evaluated on categorization accuracy.
